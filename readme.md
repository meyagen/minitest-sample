# Minitest Sample

Sample code for using minitest for a given module. `BasicStatCalculator` gives the basic stat functions applicable to an array of numbers, such as getting the sum, average, and median.

Here you'll find two basic ways of using minitest. `BasicStatCalculator_test.rb` shows the more familiar (procedural) way of coding tests, while `BasicStatCalculator_descriptive_test.rb` shows a more descriptive way of testing.

Simply run `ruby BasicStatCalculator_test.rb` or `ruby BasicStatCalculator_descriptive_test.rb` in the terminal to test `BasicStatCalculator`. Both should run 5 tests with 5 assertions and 0 failures.
